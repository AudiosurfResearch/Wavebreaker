# Wavebreaker
WIP Audiosurf custom server written in TypeScript, using Node.js, Fastify and Prisma.

# Features
Replicates most of the original server's features. Wavebreaker currently supports:
- Account system through Steam auth
- Steam friend auto-sync
- Rival/Challenger approach for competing with others instead of just mutual "friends"
- Leaderboards (Global and Nearby for now, with Friends coming soon)
- Comments/Shouts on songs
